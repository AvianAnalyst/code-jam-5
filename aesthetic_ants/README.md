# Penguin Means Business

You are a penguin. Strange evil-looking business men in suits and sunglasses 
are here to heat up the planet and destroy your beautiful ice world. All you have
are snowballs, but that's all you need to defend your homeland and
make the ice world great again!

## How to play
WASD to move

Mouse to aim and throw snowballs at the evil business men.

Try to fend off as many business people as you can; these guys will accelerate
the warming of your precious world and will melt all the ice around you!

"But penguins can swim," you say.

Ah but see, the water is very acidic as a result of these bad business people
warming the planet. So acidic, that if the penguin falls into the water, it will
die.

So, be very careful and don't fall into the water.
