Project name: Anthropodemic

Description: You are a master hacker, capable of producing some of the cleverest computer viruses known to mankind. Use your skills to write computer viruses that will attack polluting industries all over the world, causing CO2 release into the air. The more CO2 you release, the more you set humanity on a path towards uncontrollable climate change, leading to the extinction of humanity. 

--------------VIRUS INFORMATION-----------------

Viruses attack a polluting industry of your choice, one of:

	Chemical  manufacturing (code 0)
		- Weak cyber defences
		- Low CO2 output
		
	Vehicle production
		- Average cyber defences
		- Medium CO2 output
	
	Powerplant
		- Strong cyber defences
		- High CO2 output


When you create a virus you will give it Impact, Virulence and Detectability values. These affect how the virus acts in the world:

	Impact:
		- A measure of how much CO2 output is increased. A high Impact virus will quickly speed up climate change, especially when combined with a highly polluting industry such as a Powerplant.
		
	Virulence:
		- A measure of how easily a virus speads. Low Virulence may cause your virus to be contained to the country it originated in, but with high Virulence it could infect every region in the world!
		
	Detectability:
		- A measure of how likely a virus is to be detected. Lower values will allow your virus to stay longer in a region, releasing more CO2 into the air.

For every month a virus is present in a region, it raises world CO2 levels, increasing climate changes effects and gradually killing the human population.

CO2 levels are initially at 300 ppm, as this rises humans are killed at a rate of ~ 10,000,000 / ppm. New populations are calculated on a region by region basis.
