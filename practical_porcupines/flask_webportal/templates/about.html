<h1>About Practical Porcupine</h1>
<hr>
<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p class="lead">Practical Porcupine is a project hacked together for the 5th Python code jam, with the theme of
    <b>Global Warming</b>. This web-portal connects to an api (that you are most likely running on your computer right
    now (If you are, it may be <a href="0.0.0.0:8080">here</a>)! It gets 2 dates, as seen on
    the <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">home</a> page and calculates the difference between the GMWL (Global Mean Water
    Level) in mm.
    <br><br>
    To save database space and <i>show off</i>, we use data year by year, meaning that we pick a mean of each year from
    our data sources and store them. Once we have the mean of each year, we can interpolate that & get a prediction of
    what it would have been like at that specific second!</p>
