Game Design#### 3.1. CameraGame camera is in a fixed position and never moves. Player controls an image of earth which rotates around itself. Earth can be rotated by:1. Mouse touching left and right sides of screen2. A + D and < + > keyboard buttons3. (? TODO) Mouse drag left and right#### 3.2. EnvironmentGamescreen consists of:1. Earth image2. Sun image (gets bigger and brighter with time / based on task completion)3. Screen markers to help navigate to tasks4. Tasks on earth5. Tasks as new panel window#### 3.3. Game UI- Pause menu (via ESC button)    - Buttons: resume, exit- Task panel where player plays the minigame    - Buttons: exit (closes the minigame; cant be played again)#### 3.4. GameplayGameplay consists of tasks that the player needs to do to save the EARTH. On completing the task successfully, sun gets less aggresive (yay). If player is too slow on completing the tasks it causes global warming (boo).3 Difficulty settings will change how fast the game progresses and how long it will last. (TODO :: could add different earth images for different difficulties/ages).##### 3.4.1. TasksTasks will spawn randomly on earth surface that player has to complete in order to save the earth. Task theme will depend on where it spawns on earth (City, Forest, etc.).Tasks should be timed to max 10s before closing if not completed.- Cursor maze    - Players tries to move the mouse through the maze, avoiding walls.- Rock Paper Scissors    - Player gets a 1/3 chance to win. Task takes almost no time to complete.- Tic Tac Toe    - Player plays tick tac toe against the computer.#### 3.5. Game balanceTODO :: look through balance- how many different "tasks" should there be? Can they be generated to be infinite, unique, replayable every time?    - 3 tasks / minigames. Assets will be predetermined (based on biome). Gameplay/maze for cursor maze will be generated and unique every time.- on average how long should the game last?    - min (player idles and does not play):    - max (player does everything as fast as possible):    - avg:- how fast the "heat" goes up?- how fast the "tasks" spawn?- how long it should take to do the "task"?    - 3-10s    - increasing difficulty with time?- how long it should take to scroll through earth?    - ~5s ?- how many in-game days in real-time seconds?    - 1 month? (2 mins = 10 years)- what should game difficulty impact?---### 4.
